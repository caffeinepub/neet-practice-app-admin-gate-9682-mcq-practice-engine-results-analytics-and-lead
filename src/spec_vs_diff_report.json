  "summary": "Diff shows updates to PracticePage route param handling/validation and some query-hook gating, but does not provide clear evidence that per-question delete UI was removed from Contributor Panel, nor that backend read-only endpoints are accessible to unauthenticated users. Navigation fix from ChapterCategorySelectPage to PracticePage is not evidenced in the provided file diffs.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Remove the ability to delete individual questions from the Contributor Panel UI (remove any delete/trash controls, the delete confirmation dialog, and any wiring that triggers single-question deletion).",
      "reason": "ContributorPage still appears to include delete-related UI dependencies (e.g., Trash2 icon, AlertDialog components). The diff snippet is truncated and does not show removal of per-question delete controls/dialogs or deletion wiring.",

      "reason": "PracticePage now reads subject/chapterId/category from route params, but the diff does not include ChapterCategorySelectPage (or equivalent) changes showing that navigation now passes the correct route params. Without that, the end-to-end navigation restoration is not confirmed.",

      "reason": "backend/main.mo is truncated and the diff does not show any authorization-guard changes on chapter/question query endpoints (e.g., getChaptersBySubject, listChapters, getQuestionsByChapterAndCategory, getQuestionsByChapterCategoryAndYear).
