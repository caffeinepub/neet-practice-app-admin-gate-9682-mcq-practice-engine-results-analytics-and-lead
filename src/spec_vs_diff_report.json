  "summary": "Diff adds a frontend Live deployment config with a hardcoded Live name and validation helper, plus UI branding changes that reference the Live display name. However, there is no evidence in the provided diff summary of the actual Internet Computer “publish to Live/permanent” action (e.g., project rename/deployment configuration changes) being implemented.",

      "reason": "The diff shows only frontend configuration/constants and UI usage/validation. It does not show any deployment/rename/publish changes (such as IC project config, canister/app domain configuration, or release/publish pipeline changes) that would actually push a Draft deployment to Live/permanent.",
