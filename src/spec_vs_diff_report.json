However, the diff summary provides no evidence of the required backend seeding/idempotent population of NEET-syllabus chapters and year-tagged PYQ questions (REQ-4). Several additional UI/auth/profile/contributor/admin related changes appear beyond the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "Diff shows a schema/migration update to support question.year, but does not show any seed data being added nor any idempotent seeding logic that creates NEET syllabus chapters and year-tagged PYQ questions across 2025–2000 on fresh deployment.",
