# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Publish the currently deployed Draft app as a permanent Live deployment on the Internet Computer.

**Planned changes:**
- Rename the project to a valid Live domain name (5–50 characters; letters, numbers, and hyphens only; no spaces).
- Push/deploy the app to Live (permanent) instead of leaving it in Draft.
- Verify the Live deployment URL loads successfully and renders the Home page.

**User-visible outcome:** The app is accessible via a permanent Live URL that loads the Home page successfully and does not expire like Draft deployments.
